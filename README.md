# AdvertManagementAPI
An API example including authentication by JWT bearer token, hashing passwords and Swaggers docs, written in .NET Core C# framework.
 
Project was made at the end of the fourth semester at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.
 
To setup this API, you are going to need a few things:
 
1. Get a connection string for your database and inject it in the Startup.cs (through json or other means)
2. Create your SecretKey (random chain of characters) and inject it in the Startup.cs
 
Any feedback will be appreciated!
